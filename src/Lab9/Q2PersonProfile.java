/*
 2. Define a class PersonProfile. The class has a name, gender and date of birth. The class consists of a constructor and a display method. Derived a Student class from PersonProfile. The Student class has a list of course name and course code, semester, session, mark and a file name. The class consists of a constructor with student profile and file input name. All the information is retrieved from a text file named course.txt. (Please download the file from the Web site.). Create a getGrade method for the mark base on the table below:

Mark    Grade
>= 85   A
>=75    A-
>=70    B+
>=65    B 
>=60    B- 
>=55    C+ 
>=50    C 
>=45    D 
>=35    E 
<35     F 

The Student object can display the student profile as well as course details and the result in grade. Create a Tester class to test the program.
