4. Create a Dice game. The first dice game allows the player to roll two dices each time. If both dice is equal, the player can roll again. The player score each time they roll the dices. Player that reaches 100 points or more wins the game. The second dice game allows the player to roll one dice each time. When the dice is 6, the player can roll one more time. However, if the player rolls 6 again in second attempt, the player wonâ€™t have any score. Player that reaches 100 point wins the game. If the player scores more than 100, the last score is not counted and the player needs to roll again in next turn. Create a Tester class to test the program.
