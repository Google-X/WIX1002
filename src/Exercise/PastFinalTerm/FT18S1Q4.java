/*
 * 4. In a diving contest, five judges are invited to give score. However, only three scores are taken into consideration. The lowest and the highest scores are dropped. Example, if the scores are 5.5 5.5 6.5 6.5 7.0; one of the 5.5 and 7.0 are dropped. Then, the final score is calculated based on the sum of the three scores multiply the degree of difficulty. Q4.txt file contains the scores of all players. Each line consists of player nickname, five judgesâ€™ scores and the degree of difficulty. Write a program that display the final score for each player and determine the winner. 

Sample output:
Ahmad score: 40.95
David score: 44.0
Mutu score: 47.25
Fairuz score: 40.95
Mutu is the winner
